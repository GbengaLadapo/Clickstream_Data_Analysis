# Clickstream_Data_Analysis
This project aims to analyze clickstream data from retail store websites to derive actionable insights for improving user experience and increasing conversion rates.

We have successfully set up necessary GCP services, generated synthetic clickstream data(batch and streaming), and preprocessed this data using DataFlow to store in BigQuery for analysis. In addition, we are querying the BigQuery database using SQL and generating actionable insights using Google Studio. Lastly,we also conducted background research on machine learning applications and explored various GCP services such as Vertex AI for future integration. Our goal is to continuously improve our analysis capabilities and provide valuable insights to improve the user experience and conversion rates for retail store websites.
